              <h3>About 3Dicons</h3>
              <p>When I began learning blender, I came up with the idea for this project. Some of these icons were created just so I could learn how to model those tiny things. After creating those, it occurred to me that I should make them available to the community. The result is a collection of the most widely used 3D icons, which has taken me months to craft in blender. It is opensource and free for both personal and commercial use under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank">CC0</a>. So, download and start creating some cool designs. Feel free to tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/realvjy">@realvjy</a>, for any feedback</p>
