              <h3>About 3Dicons</h3>
              <p>The project started as I was learning to use blender. Some of these icons are created just as a way to learn how to model those tiny things. Eventually, I realized I must make this available to the community. In conclusion, I decided to create a large collection of the most widely used 3D icons, and it has taken me months to put it all together. It is opensource and free for both personal and commercial use under CC0. You'll enjoy it.  You can reach me at twitter.com/realvjy</p>
